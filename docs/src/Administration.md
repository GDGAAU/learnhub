## Ensuring Mentor Credibility  

At LearnHub, maintaining a high standard of education is a priority. To become a mentor on the platform, individuals must first provide evidence of their expertise in the subject they wish to teach. This verification process ensures that students receive guidance from qualified professionals.  

Prospective mentors are required to submit proof of their skills or certifications, which may include previous projects, a portfolio, a resume, or other relevant credentials. This vetting process establishes trust and credibility, reinforcing the quality of education offered on LearnHub. Only after successful verification can mentors begin creating and managing lessons, ensuring that every course meets the platform’s educational standards.  

By prioritizing mentor credibility, LearnHub fosters an environment where students can confidently engage in high-quality, peer-to-peer learning experiences.
