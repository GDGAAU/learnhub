## Encouraging Collaboration Through Discussion  

LearnHub is a **community-driven experience** where students and mentors engage in meaningful discussions. The forum feature ensures that learning is not a solitary process but a collaborative effort.  

## The Role of Forums  

Each lesson includes a **dedicated forum** where students can:  

- Ask questions and seek clarifications from their mentor  
- Share insights, perspectives, and experiences with peers  
- Work together on assignments and projects  
- Discuss industry trends and real-world applications of their lessons  

Since each mentor has no more than 10 students at a time, the forums remain focused and interactive, fostering stronger connections and deeper engagement between students and mentors.

## Why a Peer-to-Peer Approach?  

LearnHub embraces the peer-to-peer learning model because we believe learning is more effective in small, engaged groups. In these groups, discussions provide practical insights beyond the lesson content. We also understand that peer support enhances problem-solving and critical thinking. It creates a supportive learning environment where students can help each other grow  

## How Forums Enhance Learning  

- **Real-Time Interaction** – Directly engage with the mentor and fellow student
- **Structured yet Flexible** – Discussions are organized under each lesson, making it easy to navigate. 
- **Mentor Guidance** – Mentors can provide additional resources and clarify doubts. 
- **Long-Term Knowledge Sharing** – At LearnHub, learning does not end with watching a video or reading a document — it continues through active discussion, collaboration, and shared experiences.**
